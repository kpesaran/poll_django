# poll_django

## A simple polling application

Using a tutorial from https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial01/ this application consists of:

1: A public site that allows users to view polls and vote in them.
2: An administrative site that lets the admin add, change, and delete polls.
